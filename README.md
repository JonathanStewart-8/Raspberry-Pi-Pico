# Raspberry-Pi-Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico is well suited for use in embedded systems. The Raspberry Pi Pico makes use of the RP2040 microcontroller. This gives the Raspberry Pi Pico 26 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. The 26 GPIO pins support a wide variety of communication protocols including I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). The Raspberry Pi Pico also supports ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion), PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and PIO (Programmable I/O) features. All of these communcation protocols and features make the Raspberry Pi Pico a correct choice for use in embedded applications. In large part this is due to the flexablilty that the Raspberry Pi Pico offers along with its low cost and ease of use. 

The Rapberry Pi Pico supports digital inputs and outputs on all 26 GPIO pins. The Raspberry Pi Pico can also support analog inputs on the three ADC pins which are located on GPIO pins 28, 27, and 26. The analog input can be 12 bit. This gives 2 to the 12th power possible values, which is equavilent to 4096. This gives the range of potential values being from 0 to 4095 for the analog input. This allows for the reading of analog data from sensors. The Raspberry Pi Pico cannot support true analog output but it makes due with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). The PWM can simulate analog output by varying the voltage output to on and off quickly. The ration of on time to total cycle time gives the duty time, which determines the power delivered as an output. By varying the duty cycle, PWM can simulate different voltage levels. This makes it possible to control devices such as motors, fans, LEDs, or audio outputs with an analog-like effect, such as adjusting motor speed, LED brightness, or audio volume. The analog like effect is actually a digital output being switched on and off quickly making the output device responds as if it were a varying voltage. 

The Raspberry Pi Pico also supports MicroPython and C/C++. Not to mention that Raspberry Pi Pico supports multiple frameworks and ides for both languages. For MicroPython the best frameworks are
